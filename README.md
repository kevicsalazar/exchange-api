This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Server.

* `/server` is for the Ktor server application.

* `/domain` is for the code that will be shared between all targets in the project.
  The most important subfolder is `commonMain`. If preferred, you can add code to the platform-specific folders here too.
